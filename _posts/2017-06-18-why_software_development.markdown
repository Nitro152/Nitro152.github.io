**The Early Years**

The earliest computer I remember using was something similar to a Commodore. It was a keyboard that attached to our TV. The only thing I remember knowing how to do on that thing was enter commands that changed the color of the prompt/text or background. I remember being able to do something as simple as this, back then, was amazing and exciting.

The first time I remember trying to programming anything was some time in Junior High School in Turbo Pascal. It was during a summer school that I had attended and they had tried to teach me some programming. I remember that I could not wrap my head around how to get it to print a pyramid of asterisk.

**Learning to Code**

Graduating High School, I really didn’t have a plan on what I would major in, in College. Talking to my dad, he had suggested doing something in computers. Looking back now, I wonder if my parents were directing me on this path all along, as they had always made sure that we had a computer in our home. I went along and decided to major in Computer Science. 

I really enjoyed the course work and found coding to be great. It is analytical, logical, and creative all at once. Trying to figure out how to implement things into code is challenging in a satisfying way. When you run your program and it runs, there is this feeling of achievement, and it’s something that you can be proud of, something that you created. When your code isn’t work, whether it’s bad logic, or a missing semi-colon, it can be frustrating, but when your code finally does run, it’s a great feeling.

**The Present**

Out of school, I had a hard time finding a job. I found that I did not have practical skills to be marketable in the job market. Entry level positions, 1 to 2 years minimum experience required? How? I initially found work at Best Buy in their Geek Squad department and then found work as a support analyst for a time and attendance company supporting one of their applications. It’s a small company so I’ve had the opportunity to wear a few different hats, but when it comes to coding I’ve always felt like I was kind of on the outside looking in. I support the product but do not contribute directly to the application itself. I can report bugs and can do some testing on releases (I even have access to the source code), but I cannot contribute directly to the source. This is why I decided to join Flat Iron School. I feel like it will provide a full end to end understanding of web applications and will teach me the tools and best practices I will need to help me hit the ground running for a future career in development.

**The Future**

It’s crazy to see how much things have changed since those first computers. There are so many languages, IDE’s frameworks that you can use now, and so many resources, books forums and online references that you can access. It’s so much more accessible now that even kids are learning to code. I look forward to what the future will bring and would like to contribute to this future.
