In the vast ocean of programming, without a guide, I drifted from one language to another frequently. Two of those languages that I came upon was HTML and CSS. 

**HTML**

The first time I tried learning HTML was before CSS was around. It was when tables weren't used for just data, they were used for formatting as well. Writing this log, I tried to google how web pages were formatted before CSS came to be, just to make sure I wasn't crazy, but I could not find any references. 

There are some old school web pages still working that show this though. One example is the Dole Kemp 96 campaign site, [HTML Table format example](http://www.dolekemp96.org/main.htm). You can see the main body of the page is being formatted by a table. I remember seeing that you have to nest tables within tables to try to get things positioned properly on your page, and this got to be a bit much for younger me.

I also ran across a stack overflow discussion on someone trying to advocate the use of tables over CSS sometime in 2009. 
[Why not use tables for layout in HTML](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/83073/why-not-use-tables-for-layout-in-html)
I know it's moot now but it's interesting to see the resistance to the adoption of CSS.

**CSS**

When I eventually drifted back to web page design CSS was around. The separation of content to design was awesome. Everything was going well until I got to inheritance of properties for child nodes. For some reason I just remember being intimated by the thought of having to keep track of this inheritance, and it became a wall that I just did not get past.

**Today**

Coming back to both now, I really enjoyed working through some labs for HTML and CSS. Being able to produce a live page from a mockup is very cool. I have a better understanding of inheritance now and understand how CSS specificity works to override what styles are being used. Developer tools is awesome and actually shows what CSS styles are being applied to elements. I struggle a little with margin, boarder, and padding but developer tools in Chrome also displays how each of these are applied to an element as well. 

We were able to create a web site from straight HTML and CSS, and then were shown how to create the same page using the Bootstrap framework. Information was provided on how we could implement existing HTML and CSS into our pages so we don't have to create things that already exist. The amount of information, tools, and frameworks now are amazing. I look forward to learning more.
